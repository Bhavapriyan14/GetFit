        What is fitness?
       </h2>

       <p>
        Fitness refers to a person's physical and mental well-being, encompassing their overall health, strength, endurance, and agility. Achieving fitness involves regular exercise, a balanced diet, and adequate rest. Physical fitness enhances muscle tone, cardiovascular health, and flexibility, reducing the risk of chronic diseases like obesity and heart disease. Mental fitness involves emotional stability, cognitive sharpness, and stress management. It promotes a positive outlook and improved quality of life. Fitness goals vary, from weight loss to athletic performance, and can be tailored to individual needs. Ultimately, fitness empowers individuals to lead healthier, more active lives and enjoy a higher level of vitality.

        <h1>What is calorie deficit?</h1>

        <p>
            A calorie deficit occurs when you consume fewer calories than your body expends in a day, resulting in weight loss. To lose weight, your body needs to burn more calories than it takes in. When you create a calorie deficit through a combination of reducing calorie intake and increasing physical activity, your body starts to use stored energy, primarily in the form of fat, to meet its energy needs. Over time, this leads to a reduction in body weight and body fat.</p>
